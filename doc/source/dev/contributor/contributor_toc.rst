Contributor Table of Contents
=============================

This table of contents is designed to help you quickly find the information you need about SciPy development after you've reviewed the introductory material in :ref:`hacking`. If you're new to this and want to start coding ASAP, you've find the right place. Start with the bold links (in order), then expand your knowledge with the rest.

- :ref:`dev-env` - how to set up and maintain a development environment, including installing compilers and SciPy dependencies, creating a personal fork of the SciPy repository on GitHub, using git to manage a local repository with development branches, performing an in-place build of SciPy, and creating a virtual environment that adds this development version of SciPy to the Python path
- :ref:`editing-scipy` - how to edit SciPy Python code, with tips on finding which module contains SciPy functionality to be edited, adding new modules to SciPy, and complying with PEP8 style standards
- :ref:`unit-tests` - how to write and run unit tests for SciPy with the pytest framework
- :ref:`docs` - how to write reStructuredText documentation that complies with docstring standards, build documentation locally, and view documentation built during continuous integration checks
- :ref:`benchmarking` - how to benchmark code with AirSpeed Velocity
- :ref:`cython` - how to add fast, compiled code to SciPy
